This notebook demonstrates a classification task using synthetic data. It follows these steps:


Overview:
Data Generation: Uses Scikit-Learn to create a dataset of two interleaving circles with different class labels.
Visualization: Plots the generated dataset to observe class distribution.
Data Preprocessing: Converts NumPy arrays into tensors for further processing.
Model Training: Implements a classification model using deep learning techniques.
Evaluation: Assesses model performance using standard classification metrics.

The notebook relies on the following libraries:
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
NumPy
PyTorch

Purpose:
The purpose of this notebook is to showcase a basic classification pipeline, useful for understanding data representation, model training, and evaluation.
